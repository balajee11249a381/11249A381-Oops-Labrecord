2. Member Function Inside and Outside Class

Aim:
To implement member functions inside and outside the class.
To understand the use of scope resolution operator.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Define a class with private members.
3. Declare one function inside and another outside the class.
4. Define the external function using :: operator.
5. Create an object in main().
6. Call both functions using the object.
7. Stop the program.

Program:


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
    int length, breadth;
public:
    void getData(int l, int b);
    int area() { return length * breadth; }
};

void Rectangle::getData(int l, int b) {
    length = l;
    breadth = b;
}

int main() {
    Rectangle rect;
    int l, b;
    cout << "Enter length and breadth: ";
    cin >> l >> b;
    rect.getData(l, b);
    cout << "Area of Rectangle = " << rect.area() << endl;
    return 0;
}


Output:


Enter length and breadth: 6 4
Area of Rectangle = 24


Result:
Member functions were successfully defined inside and outside the class.
The use of the scope resolution operator is verified.
