Passing and Returning Objects*

Aim:
To implement passing objects as arguments in a function.
To demonstrate returning objects from a function.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program and define a Complex class.
2. Declare data members for real and imaginary parts.
3. Define functions for setting and adding data.
4. Pass one object as argument and return another.
5. Create and call functions in main().
6. Display the resultant object.
7. Stop the program.

Program:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
    int real, imag;
public:
    void setData(int r, int i) {
        real = r; imag = i;
    }

    Complex add(Complex c2) {
        Complex temp;
        temp.real = real + c2.real;
        temp.imag = imag + c2.imag;
        return temp;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1, c2, c3;
    c1.setData(3, 4);
    c2.setData(5, 7);
    c3 = c1.add(c2);
    cout << "Sum of complex numbers: ";
    c3.display();
    return 0;
}


Output:

Sum of complex numbers: 8 + 11i


Result:
Objects were successfully passed and returned between functions.
The result of addition of complex numbers was displayed.
