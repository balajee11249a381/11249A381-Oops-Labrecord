5. Constructors and Destructor*

Aim:
To demonstrate the use of constructors and destructor.
To implement default, parameterized, and copy constructors.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Define a class with constructors and a destructor.
3. Initialize values using constructors.
4. Create multiple objects in main().
5. Display their values.
6. Observe destructor invocation at program end.
7. Stop the program.

Program:

cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    string name;
    int marks;
public:
    Student() {
        name = "Default";
        marks = 0;
        cout << "Default Constructor called\n";
    }

    Student(string n, int m) {
        name = n;
        marks = m;
        cout << "Parameterized Constructor called\n";
    }

    Student(Student &s) {
        name = s.name;
        marks = s.marks;
        cout << "Copy Constructor called\n";
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << " | Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }

    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called for " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;
    Student s2("Ravi", 90);
    Student s3(s2);
    s1.display();
    s2.display();
    s3.display();
    return 0;
}


Output:


Default Constructor called
Parameterized Constructor called
Copy Constructor called
Name: Default | Marks: 0
Name: Ravi | Marks: 90
Name: Ravi | Marks: 90
Destructor called for Default
Destructor called for Ravi
Destructor called for Ravi


Result:
Constructors and destructor executed as expected.
Object initialization and cleanup were demonstrated.
