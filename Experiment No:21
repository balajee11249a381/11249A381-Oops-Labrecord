21. Program to Implement Exception Handling in C++

Aim:

To demonstrate the use of *exception handling* using try, catch, and throw.

Algorithm:

1. Read two numbers.
2. If the denominator is zero, throw an exception.
3. Catch the exception and display an error message.
4. Otherwise, perform division.

Program:

cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    try {
        if (b == 0)
            throw b;
        cout << "Result = " << a / b << endl;
    } catch (int) {
        cout << "Error: Division by zero is not allowed." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}


Output:


Enter two numbers: 10 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.


Result:

Successfully demonstrated *exception handling* in C++.
