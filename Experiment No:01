1. Illustrate Class and Objects

Aim:
To study the concept of class and object in C++.
To define and access data members using objects.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program and include header files.
2. Define a class with data members and member functions.
3. Create methods to input and display values.
4. Create an object of the class in main().
5. Call member functions through the object.
6. Display the stored values.
7. Stop the program.

Program:

cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    string name;
    int rollNo;
    float marks;
public:
    void input() {
        cout << "Enter Student Name: ";
        cin >> name;
        cout << "Enter Roll Number: ";
        cin >> rollNo;
        cout << "Enter Marks: ";
        cin >> marks;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "\n--- Student Details ---\n";
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Roll Number: " << rollNo << endl;
        cout << "Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.input();
    s.display();
    return 0;
}


Output:

Input:
Enter Student Name: Arjun
Enter Roll Number: 101
Enter Marks: 92.5

output:
Name: Arjun
Roll Number: 101
Marks: 92.5


Result:
The concept of class and object is successfully demonstrated.
Data was accessed and displayed using an object.
