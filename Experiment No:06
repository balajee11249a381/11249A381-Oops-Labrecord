6. Static Data Member and Function*

Aim:
To illustrate static data member and static member function.
To show how static members share data among objects.

Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Define a class with a static data member.
3. Initialize it outside the class.
4. Increment it in the constructor.
5. Define a static function to show count.
6. Create multiple objects.
7. Display total count.

Program:

cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    static int count;
public:
    Counter() {
        count++;
    }
    static void showCount() {
        cout << "Total objects created: " << count << endl;
    }
};

int Counter::count = 0;

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3, c4;
    Counter::showCount();
    return 0;
}


Output:


Total objects created: 4


Result:
Static data members retained a common value among objects.
Static functions accessed static data successfully.
